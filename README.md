# PROCESS QUALITY MANAGEMENT

## ABSTRACT
In this study, we make use of DMAIC Six-Sigma Model to improve the quality of process of producing cuboidal shaped MS pipes. Manufacturing sector is instrumental in driving economic growth of a country. Several steps have been taken in the past few years to strengthen the manufacturing capabilities in the country. Besides strengthening the logistic and supply chain infrastructure there is a need to build on the global quality standards and innovation culture for right positioning of Indian produce in the global supply chains. 
This study discusses the implementation of a Six Sigma quality improvement project in an Indian MNC organization involved in the manufacturing of MS pipes with an aim to reduce the repairs and rejections. We also illustrate an effective multi-criteria defect prioritization analysis based on AHP methodology to identify the key defects to prioritize the improvement efforts. This method prioritizes the key defect considering 
various other attributes such as critical to customers rather than only the frequency of defects. 
The study also illustrates application of several quality management techniques such as cause and effect analysis, current reality tree, inter- relationship diagram, SIPOC analysis and quality control charts in the DMAIC stages.

## INTRODUCTION
### QUALITY
The word “quality” has diverse definitions, ranging from the conventional to those that are strategic. Conventional definitions of quality usually describe a quality item as one that wears well, is well constructed and will last for a long time. However, managers competing in the fierce international marketplace are increasingly concerned with the strategic definition of quality—meeting customer requirements. 

Quality is meeting and exceeding the present and future requirements of the customer on a continuous basis. 

### DIMENSION OF QUALITY
1. Performance: Potential customers usually evaluate a product to determine if it will perform certain specific functions and determine how well it performs them.
2. Reliability: Complex products, such as many appliances, automobiles, or airplanes, will usually require some repair over their service life.
3. Durability: This is the effective service life of the product. Customers obviously want products that perform satisfactorily over a long period of time.
4. Serviceability: There are many industries in which the customer’s view of quality is directly influenced by how quickly and economically a repair or routine maintenance activity can be accomplished.
5. Aesthetics: This is the visual appeal of the product, often taking into account factors such as style, color, shape, packaging alternatives, tac tile characteristics, and other sensory features.
6. Features: Usually, customers associate high quality with products that have added features; that is, those that have features beyond the basic performance of the competition.
7. Perceived Quality: In many cases, customers rely on the past reputation of the company concerning quality of its products. This reputation is directly influenced by failures of the product that are highly visible to the public or that require product recalls, and by how the customer is treated when a quality-related problem with the product is reported.
8. Conformance to Standards:  We usually think of a highquality product as one that exactly meets the requirements placed on it.

## TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Total Quality Management (TQM) is an organizational management approach that focuses on producing quality products and services to fulfill customer needs. As a quality management technique, TQM involves all workers to maintain high standards of work across the entire company. Implementing TQM can help improve employee productivity, increase customer satisfaction, and achieve competitive advantage. 

## STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL
Statistical process control (SPC) is a method of quality control which uses statistical methods. SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process. Monitoring and controlling the process ensures that it operates at its full potential. At its full potential, the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum (if not an elimination) of waste (rework or scrap). 

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an industry-standard methodology for measuring and controlling quality during the manufacturing process. Quality data in the form of Product or Process measurements are obtained in real-time during manufacturing.
SPC is one of the greatest technological developments of the twentieth century because it is based on sound underlying principles, is easy to use, has significant impact, and can be applied to any process. Its seven major tools are 
1. Pareto chart  
2. Cause-and-effect diagram  
3. Check sheet  
4. Histogram  
5. Scatter diagram  
6. Control charts  
7. Graphs

## SIX SIGMA
Six Sigma is a widely practiced, systematic and structured methodology embedded with statistical methods and managerial philosophies for quality improvement by large firms along with small firms in the industrialized economies. Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement.

### ANALYTICAL HEIRARCHY PROCESS (AHP)
The AHP approach, developed by Saaty (1980), is one of the more extensively used MCDM methods. The AHP has been applied to a wide variety of decisions and the human judgment process. The approach is used to construct an evaluation model and has criterion weights. It integrates different measures into a single overall score for ranking decision alternatives. 

## PROBLEM DEFINITION
JAY AAY ALLOYS(P) LIMITED is one of the company engaged in service for making the product billets, hr coil strip and different size and shape pipes. They are using their standard process used to manufacture the MS pipes. JAY AAY ALLOYS is manufacturing cuboidal shape MS pipe with dimension 20ft long, 3inch width, 1inch height and 2.6mm thick and these type of pipe is having major defects of irregular surfacing, irregular edges, rusting, indentation(dent) etc. so that’s why we are focusing on improving the process control of manufacturing the cuboidal pipes. 
 
The ever increasing competition from the global market, the company always wants to put into practice the concept of Total Quality and to adopt Zero Defects policy, especially when it comes to a product that is critical to life.  
 
Since obtaining a high quality of 100% non-defective product is impossible just by inspection, numerous statistical and quantifiable ways have been introduced to reduce the overall number of defects as well as to continue improving the benchmarks obtained. This project presents an application of Quality Management principles for manufacturing of cuboidal shaped pipe, which is concluded through an action plan for improving product quality level and implementing the suggestions provided. In this study, quality management tools are used to establish specific inspection methods to detect the defect type which 
causes maximum rejection and to prevent their appearance in product. This is a first-time quality check method. Hence, rework and scrap are taken as defectives. Also, Quality checking is always a continuous improvement methodology wherein defects are eliminated after every inspection resulting in lesser number of rejections and hence improving quality level.

## SCOPE OF STUDY
The demand for higher value at reduced price is increasing on the consumer front. As a result, manufacturers are increasingly adopting quality improvement techniques to improve productivity and quality, reduce waste and thereby providing higher value at moderate cost. The data driven Six Sigma quality improvement methodology provides a framework to identify, eliminate and control the causes of variation in an operational process. Improvement using the Six Sigma technique can increase the quality of the product and reduce the number of defective items for the particular product. JAY AAY ALLOYS(P) LIMITED want the sigma level of their product nearly equal or greater than 4.0.  
 
This project mainly focused on six sigma quality philosophy and other related philosophy that would be implemented in these studies in order to identify the current problem or rejection criteria facing by the company. The “Six Sigma” DMAIC Model is used because, it provides a step-by-step quality improvement methodology that uses statistical methods to quantify variation.  The integration of AHP and Pareto Charts will help the company identify their CTQ (critical to quality) defects and analyze on them is done.  
 
In this case, the company loses a huge amount of money which must be nipped. Apart from these, a total quality check is important for a company so as to maintain its goodwill as well as reputation in the industry. Keeping this in mind, the study will only prove to be beneficial if the process of quality checking is done on a continuous basis. 
 
Continuous Quality Improvement involves setting the standards and then continually improving those standards. Hence, after implementing the corrective measures improvement data was calculated and based on which new standards are being set up for the company.

## DMAIC (SOLUTION METHODOLOGY)
We will use DMAIC (Define – Measure – Analyze – Improve – Control) Six Sigma Model to solve the problem. 
 
Define phase of the DMAIC model helps in understanding and documenting the problem. In this project, SIPOC diagram have been used in the define phase. SIPOC diagram documents complete information about the process and their related inputs and outputs.  
 
During the Measure phase, based on problem definition key defects are prioritized and the baseline process performance is measured. AHP, check sheet data, p-chart, pareto charts and process sigma level have been used in this study to prioritize and measure the process performance. Data collection is done using check sheet, p-chart for fraction defective has been used to check whether the process is under control or not and baseline sigma level is calculated.  
 
Analyze phase of DMAIC model is aimed at identifying the causes and root causes of the key defects. Cause C&E diagram, Inter-relationship Diagrams (IRD), Current Reality Tree (CRT) and Cause and Effect Matrix (C&E Matrix) method have been used to identify the important causes and root causes of the vital defects in the process.  
 
The improve phase follows the analyze stage wherein the improvement efforts are established and implemented to address the root cause of the problem. Aim is to evaluate the potential solutions of the identified root causes. In the control phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC model, the process is monitor and controls the improvement efforts to sustain the process sigma level.

## CONCLUSION
As observed in the previous process-wise analysis, we know that the sigma level i.e. the performance level of all the processes improved significantly after implementing the suggested measures which led to the reduction of the frequencies of various defects and thus ultimately the frequencies of defectives in each process. 
Also, there is significant decrease in number of defects. 
Thus, there is significant improvement of process performance level and as all the manufacturing firm desire, the process is moving towards achieving even higher sigma levels. Also, these results may improve as the process settles down in long term observations. 
Also, the company was aiming to achieve a sigma level greater than or equal to 4 which has been achieved here, but as mentioned, this result may get improved as the process gets standardized with due course of time.
